## Create Custom Application in Merchant Center

To create a Custom Application in the Merchant Center, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the "Register a Custom Application" page.
2. Register a new application with the following values:
  - **Name:** For example, "Powerboard App".
  - **entryPointUriPath:** For example, "powerboard-app".
  - Additional fields as required.

Additionally, you will need to add the following pages:

- `/project_key/{entryPointUriPath}/liveconnection` - To set up a live connection (gateway, supported cards, fraud prevention, etc.) to the Powerboard system.
- `/project_key/{entryPointUriPath}/sandboxconnection` - To set up a sandbox connection (gateway, supported cards, fraud prevention, etc.) to the Powerboard system.
- `/project_key/{entryPointUriPath}/widgetconfiguration` - To customize the styles of the widget integrated into Sunrise and other frontend frameworks.
- `/project_key/{entryPointUriPath}/orders` - To manage orders processed through our payment system, such as changing order statuses.
- `/project_key/{entryPointUriPath}/logs` - To display and review logs for better transparency and troubleshooting.
