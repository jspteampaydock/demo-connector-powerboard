## How It Works
The Powerboard system supports a variety of webhook events, which are automated messages triggered in response to specific activities such as updates, refunds, and manual captures. Supported events include:
- Transaction Success
- Transaction Failure
- Subscription Transactions (Success and Failure)
- Fraud Checks (Success and Failure)
- Refund Actions (Requested, Success, and Failure)
- And more...

## Add Notifications
Notifications can be added in two ways:
1. **Via Commercetools Powerboard Custom Application:**
   Setting notifications via the [Commercetools Powerboard Custom Application](https://github.com/CommBank-PowerBoard/powerboard-e-commerce-commercetools-app) automates the configuration within Powerboard after you save the settings.

2. **Directly Through Powerboard Account:**
   You can also manually add notifications by navigating to the notifications section in your [Powerboard account](https://www.commbank.com.au).

## Processing Notifications
When actions related to charges occur in Powerboard (e.g., status changes, refunds), our module receives a notification. For example:

```

                "event": "transaction_success",
                "notification": {

                        }
                    ],
                    "transaction": {
                        "id": "***",
                        "external_id": "***",
                        "external_reference": "**",
                        "amount": ***,

                        "type": "sale",
                        "status": "complete",

                        "fraud": {}
                    }
                }
            }
        }
```
Our module then uses the ***refernce***  field to locate the corresponding payment in the commercetools system. If found, the payment information is updated accordingly.

## Test

To run tests, use the following command:

```
npm run test
```
